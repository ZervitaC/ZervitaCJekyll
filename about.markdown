Hello there, my name is Zervita Chloe Charles, and I am a first year Biology and Geography major at the [Dominica State College](http://http://dsc.edu.dm/). My interest in these courses has strengthened as a result of my undergraduate studies. In addition, I became interested in interdisciplinary fields that scientifically connect the environment and  life, such as marine biology and environmental science, which I hope to pursue in the future. My associate degree has also increased my passion for marine and wildlife conservation. I have a fascination for coding which was introduced to me in my third year at the Convent High School with the programming code, Pascal N-IDE and C++ in my fourth and fifth year. In my free time, I enjoy reading about other programming languages like Java. I  also write poetry, paint and bake.
