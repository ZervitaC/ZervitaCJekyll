Retrieved March 23, 2022, from[ https://www.amazon.com/](https://www.amazon.com/)Amazon.com, Inc. is a global technology business based in the United States that specialises in e-commerce, cloud services, digital entertainment, and machine intelligence.

Using previous coding skills learned in high school and further research, I will construct three sets of code per country so that my tables will run efficiently.
