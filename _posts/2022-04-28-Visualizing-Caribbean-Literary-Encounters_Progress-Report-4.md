During this time, I was still clearing up all the data on the Spreadsheet. Despite a few glitches, such as recognising authors of dubious Caribbean descent or literary works that are outside of the scope of the project content, I felt that seeking clarification by posting comments on the spreadsheet was quite helpful. Dr Esprit's HIS 115 classes resumed. We began readings on Schuyler Esprit, Library as Text, Place, and Tool, and Kate Theimer, Archives in Context and as Context, the week of January 17. Dr Schuyler Esprit's Topography, Topology, Typography: The Library as Place, Text, and Tool in Caribbean Digital Research Classrooms was the first reading mentioned. The Hypothesis tool was also a wonderful experience. The concept of social annotations is terrific, and I had a fun time annotating the sections of Dr Esprit's webpage. In the second reading, Kate Theimer talks about archives in and as context, as well as the necessity for improved communication between digital humanists and professionals like archivists in the areas where respective disciplines cross.

We also examined old methodologies and uncovered a few development ventures from other Digital Humanities Academics during this session. It was great to envisage these new projects because they opened my eyes to the limitless potential of the Digital Humanities sector. As a Digital Humanities pupil who is about to embark on an individual digital project, the exposure to the new tools twine and hypothesis was a welcome complement to my existing knowledge of DH technologies. Ultimately, I considered twine to be relatively simple to work with.

The Introduction to Arcgis class was the most interesting due to one of my majors being Geography. I enjoyed Dr Esprit's ability to provide some perspective and her experience with a project in which she mapped out the village where she grew up. She truly changed my perspective as to the way some of the buildings in Mahaut are built. She also told us about how slaves were only granted a little plot of land to begin their settlement.
