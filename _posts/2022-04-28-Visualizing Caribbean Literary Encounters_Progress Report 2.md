This week, I focused on my search for works by Caribbean authors. There were various methods I tried last week to help me obtain these books however one method proved to be more successful. I typed a specific country with the word author following, for instance ‘Cuban authors’, into my search engine and researched the books published by each author. This allowed me to view a wide selection of books and pinpoint those that were in my year range. This research revealed to me how the topics on which Caribbean authors write alter throughout time. This research revealed to me how the topics on which Caribbean authors write alter throughout time. From the 1800s through the late 2000s, numerous authors wrote about enslavement and other issues that were current at the time. Authors from 2011 to 2022, on the other hand, write about current events such as contemporary romance and global issues in addition to fiction.

However, I had a few difficulties with finding the original publication date. So, in order to resolve this issue, I had to Google the book and obtain the correct date of publication before exporting it to Zotero. However, as time passes, the entire body of literary work becomes more manageable.
We also attended a lecture with Mr Alex Gil to discuss minimal computing and Wax, which is centred on producing flexible, low-cost, long-lasting websites. Dr Esprit also described how the metadata acquired from every book will be transferred as a CSV file, which would be used to construct the wax site. In order to generate a more detailed list of literary texts that more truly depicts the Caribbean literary realm between 1951 and 1960, I believe I must quadruple my research efforts in the following weeks.

Overall, my hunt for books published by Caribbean authors is teaching me a lot, my research abilities are growing, and I'm getting increasingly curious about the literary world.
