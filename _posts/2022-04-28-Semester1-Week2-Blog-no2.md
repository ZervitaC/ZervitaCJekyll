For week two’s reading, William Thomas G. excellently expounded in his journal, “What We Think We Build and What We Build in Digital Humanities”, what we think we will build and what we build are often quite different, and unexpectedly so. Even so, as Melville warned, the archive “however authentic” offers only “a glancing bird`s eye view of what has been promiscuously saying, thought, fancied, and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and generations, including our own. ” When we produce a work of scholarship in whatever form, Jerome McGann reminds us that “to make anything is also to make a speculative foray into a concealed but wished for unknown. ” The work that we make, McGann tells us, “is not the achievement of one`s desire: it is the shadow of that desire.”Trevor Owens also stated in his Journal “Please Write It down”, that everybody working on a digital humanities project needs to be writing. As he suggested, every document and artefact created in the process of design could serve as a new genre of humanities scholarship. With that said, he also suggested that at the end of a project, taking time to sit down and write out what was learned is an invaluable reflective practice. Taking a few moments at the end of a project to reflect on what you wanted to accomplish, what actually happened, and what was learned from the process is critical not only for communicating results but for really coming to know them. As a first-year at Dominica State College compared to being a high schooler, I agree with these words. I always need to understand my work, if not, I’ve lost the concept of the topic I’m studying or researching which leads to failing my work.

For week three’s readings, we covered Metadata. Before our discussion, I had little knowledge of metadata as well as the various types.

1. Descriptive metadata is relevant to the information and provides additional details about it. Descriptive metadata is data that provides information about the user who created the file, when and where the file was created, and the size of the file such as a collection of information such as author, file size, document creation date, and keywords that describe the document.

2. Structural metadata refers to data from many different files and describes its fields to show how similar information is stored and what it means. Examples are indexes and tables of contents.

3. Administrative Metadata is data that provides administrators with information to help manage a resource. There are three subsets of administrative metadata which are technical metadata, preservation metadata, and rights metadata.
   The metadata can: Describe resources at each level of aggregation, and describe the components of collections, individual resources, and large resources. It can be embedded in a digital object or saved individually. Often, one of the embedded languages is the header of HTML documents and image files.



   The Text Encoding Initiative is probably the most important project in the field of digital humanities. It provides guidelines for digitally creating all types of data created and used by digital humanists. This data includes manuscripts, archived documents, and more. TEI is used to create digital documents or databases. It also facilitates information management and website creation. One of the advantages of TEI and XML software is that the information it collects is a series of machine-readable characters that looks the same in all software that uses it.
   I gained a deeper understanding of metadata as well as furthered my knowledge through extensive research.
