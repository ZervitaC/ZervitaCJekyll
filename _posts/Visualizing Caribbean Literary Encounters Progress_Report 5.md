We went over text encoding again, spoke about topic modelling, and went over Voyant. Text encoding refers to the mixing of foreign terms such as punctuation with the natural language writing system's familiar flow. Text mining is a type of topic modelling. It is a method of detecting patterns in a collection. Voyant is a web-based digital humanity tool that may be used for text reading and analysis. Voyant is a research initiative that aims to improve reading and interpretive processes for digital humanists, scholars, and the general public. We revisited Voyant and analysed texts as well as the features and capabilities that Voyant offers.

We revisited technologies and digital humanism terms while simultaneously focusing on our individual projects. We were to produce a 500-word proposal for our individual digital humanities project for the Individual Initiative, which would be submitted as part of our much larger Visualizing Caribbean Literature project. We were to present our proposal while adhering to the requirements provided, such as considering a specific theme, genre, structure, author, and relation that we would like to explore. As part of the guidelines, we were also to use no less than two tools. I instantly started thinking about my project's theme, and the first thing that sprang to mind was children. I titled it “The Blast From Our Childhood Literary Past” where I would research literary textbooks and storybooks used in grades 2-9. The tools I will be using are Wax and Jekyll.

Finally, we continued tidying up the data in the Visualizing Caribbean Literature spreadsheet. I was still assigned to research the genre of other works, which took time. I would also have to translate titles into various languages and use different columns to help with my final answer. Over time, the spreadsheet is gradually becoming cleaner which would further help me finish my column.
