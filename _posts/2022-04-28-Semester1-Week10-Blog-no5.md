This week's topic was Minimal Computing. I had no idea what minimal computing was or what it included before now. The term "minimal computing" refers to computing performed under a set of considerable equipment, programs, knowledge, connectivity, power, or other constraints. It entails machine maintenance, refurbishment, and the usage of machines for Digital Humanities work. This is done because of necessity, but it also includes the use of new streamlined computing gear, like that of the Raspberry Pi or the Arduino microcontroller, to perform Digital Humanities work on a voluntary basis. Now, one must work at the crossroads of choices and need, which brings crucial concepts and practices in the Digital Humanities community to the forefront. Minimal computing is concerned with commercial, structural, and material circumstances such as aesthetics, heritage, the environment, international power dynamics, and research processes. The Digital Humanities Minimal Computing Group then discussed what needed to be done. They include:

1.Provide a space for generating and sharing discussion and resources exploring the practice and impact of minimal computing from both a practical and theoretical perspective.
2.Shine a spotlight on a large portion of humanities work that is currently going unnoticed, enabling further research to take place in these areas
3.Fold in (rather than appropriate) this sort of work into academic work for discussion and analysis
4.Raise cultural awareness and explore questions such as:
-- In digital humanities and other computing contexts, what is being done with what technologies, how, and why?
-- What are best practices for application construction in order to maximize availability, decrease obsolescence, and reduce e-waste?
-- What are the social impacts of digitization and computing from a post-colonial perspective?
-- How does doing minimal computing by choice differ from doing minimal computing by necessity? Does this result in different interactions between the user and the technology?
-- In terms of computing and culture, what meaningful differences emerge across economical, infrastructural, and material conditions?

Further reading on "The User, the Learner, and the Machines We Make" by Alex Gil elucidates minimal computing, users, learners, and the machines that they make.  Minimal computing is the use of minimalist concepts in computers in general. In fact, though, minimal computing is really in the eyes of society. The skillset for using a Raspberry Pi might be intimidating for beginners, necessitating more than minimal effort. On the other side, on a user interface, removing clutter such as distracting aesthetics can be seen as part of a minimalist approach that makes it easier for users to engage. Alex Gil prefers the "What do we need?" approach to minimal computing. He feels that by doing so, somebody's orientations toward simplicity of its use, ease of invention, enhanced access, and computing reductions become evident.

We also covered topics such as Wax. Wax is a basic computing project aimed at creating digital exhibitions that are long-lasting, low-cost, and flexible. The underlying technology is designed for learning and teaching, and it is capable of producing beautifully rendered, high-quality image galleries and academic exhibitions. Through basic text editing along with the combination of Wax and Jekyll, a static site generator, almost anything can be produced.
