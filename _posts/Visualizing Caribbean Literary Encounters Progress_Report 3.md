title: "Visualizing Caribbean Literary Encounters Progress: Report 3"
categories: Blog Posts

As part of my work on the "Visualizing Caribbean Literary Encounters" project, I resumed my search for all literature written by Caribbean authors between 1951 and 1960 this week. As we continue to work on the WAX installation in class and make steady progress toward the next stage of the project, I have gradually begun accumulating resources, for a quantity of the literary publications placed in my Zotero folder. I also feel that in the following weeks, I will need to become more acquainted with using WAX and GitHub, as this will affect my productivity and effectiveness on the project in the future.

On January 5th, 2022, data from Zotero was imported into a spreadsheet so the students could collaborate and arrange the data. Everybody has been editing the data column that has been allotted to them for the past few weeks. I selected the column, genre which Dr Esprit said was a challengeâ€¦and a challenge it was. My job was to investigate each book, determine its category, and enter it into the spreadsheet. The options of the genre were fiction (novel/novella), fiction (short story collection), poetry collection, drama, short story, poem, essay, nonfiction book, biography, and autobiography/memoir. I utilized websites such as Google Books, Book Finder, World Cat and others. First, I copied either the title and pasted it into my search engine and searched for the genre on archival sites, or copied the ISBN and pasted it into the search bar and hoped-for results that would direct me to online bookstores. These options either provided me with the genre or a description of the book and I used my analytic skills to determine the genre.

During my research, I encountered numerous obstacles. First, most of the information needed for my research in the necessary columns was still empty. Second, I found it difficult to concentrate because I had to continuously scroll horizontally and forth across the spreadsheet because the important columns were far apart. However, Dr Esprit realised this and split the sheet so that the publication year and title remained together and we were given the freedom to scroll through the rest of the sheet.
